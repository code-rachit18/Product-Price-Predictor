## 📌 Overview
E-commerce platforms often list a wide range of products across multiple categories, making it challenging to set competitive yet profitable prices.  
This project leverages **Machine Learning** to predict product prices based on **category, brand, product description, and features**.  

The model is trained on a curated dataset and designed to generalize across various product categories — from fashion and electronics to home appliances.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔮 Predicts realistic product prices based on textual and categorical inputs  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with insightful visualizations  
- ⚡ Machine Learning pipeline with preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression models  
- 🧪 Model evaluation using R² score, RMSE, and cross-validation  
- 🌐 Ready for API/Frontend integration  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Modeling:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (extendable to deep learning)  
- **Deployment (optional):** Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit
